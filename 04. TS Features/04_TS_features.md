En el pasado, ya hemos revisado varias características de las series de
tiempo. La paquetería [`feasts`](https://feasts.tidyverts.org/)
*(**F**ature **E**xtraction **A**nd **S**tatistics from **T**ime
**S**eries)* incluye varias funciones para calcular varias
características. Cualquier tipo de resumen que le podamos realizar a
una serie de tiempo se consideraría una característica.

### Características estadísticas básicas

Algunas de las más sencillas son la media, mínimo, máximo, … y las
podemos calcular utilizando la función `features()`. Tomemos de ejemplo
los datos del turismo en Australia, `tourism`.

``` r
library("easypackages")
packages("tidyverse","lubridate", "patchwork", "fpp2","fpp3","scales","DT")
glimpse(tourism)
```

``` r
tourism %>% features(Trips, list(mean =mean))
```

    ## # A tibble: 304 x 4

    ##    <chr>          <chr>              <chr>     <dbl>

    ##  3 Adelaide       South Australia    Other     56.6 
    ##  4 Adelaide       South Australia    Visiting 205.  
    ##  5 Adelaide Hills South Australia    Business   2.66
    ##  6 Adelaide Hills South Australia    Holiday   10.5 
    ##  7 Adelaide Hills South Australia    Other      1.40
    ##  8 Adelaide Hills South Australia    Visiting  14.2 
    ##  9 Alice Springs  Northern Territory Business  14.6

    ## # ... with 294 more rows

La paquetería `DT` nos permite crear `datatables` o tablas interactivas.

``` r
tourism %>% features(Trips, list(mean =mean)) %>% datatable(filter = "top")
```

Calculamos la característica de la media y se muestra en la columna
`V1`. Si queremos calcular varias características y nombrarlas, lo
podemos hacer así:

``` r
tourism %>% features(Trips, list(media = mean, 
                                 min = min,
                                 max = max)) %>% arrange(media)
```

Como hemos visto anteriormente, existen 5 estadísticas básicas que se
deben analizar: el mínimo, primer cuartil, mediana, tercer cuartil y
máximo. La función `quantile()` nos ayuda a calcularlas de manera
sencilla:

``` r
tourism %>% features(Trips, quantile, prob=seq(0,1,by=0.25))
```

### Características de la función de autocorrelación, ACF

La función `feat_acf()` provee características interesantes acerca de
una serie de tiempo:

  - El primer coeficiente de autocorrelación de los datos originales,
    `acf1`.
  - La suma del cuadrado de los primeros 10 coeficientes de
    autocorrelación, de los datos originales, `acf10`. Este coeficiente
    nos dice qué tanta autocorrelación tiene la serie, sin importar el
    rezago.
  - El primer coeficiente de autocorrelación de las primeras
    diferencias, `diff1_acf1`.
  - La suma del cuadrado de los primeros 10 coeficientes de
    autocorrelación, de las primeras diferencias, `diff1_acf10`.
  - El primer coeficiente de autocorrelación de las segundas
    diferencias, `diff2_acf1`.
  - La suma del cuadrado de los primeros 10 coeficientes de
    autocorrelación, de las segundas diferencias, `diff2_acf10`.
  - Para datos estacionales, también se obtiene el coeficiente de
    autocorrelación en el primer rezago estacional.

### Características STL

Se puede definir la **fuerza del componente de tendencia o estacional**
de la siguiente manera:

\[
F_{T} = \max \left(0,1-\frac{\operatorname{Var}\left(R_{t}\right)}{\operatorname{Var}\left(T_{t}+R_{t}\right)}\right)
\] Esto para el caso de la tendencia. Similarmente, para medir la fuerza
del componente estacional:

\[
F_{S} = \max \left(0,1-\frac{\operatorname{Var}\left(R_{t}\right)}{\operatorname{Var}\left(S_{t}+R_{t}\right)}\right)
\] En ambos casos, lo que indican las ecuaciones es que la fuerza está
medida entre cero y uno, siendo cero el indicador de nula o muy pequeña
tendencia y/o estacionalidad, y valores cercanos a uno indicando una
fuerte tendencia y/o estacionalidad.

Esto es útil cuando se quiere discernir cuáles series de tiempo tienen
la mayor estacionalidad o tendencia. Otras características interesantes
son las del tiempo de los picos y valles; qué mes o trimestre es el de
mayor estacionalidad y cuál el de menor, p. ej.

Podemos obtener todas estas características con la función `feat_stl()`.
